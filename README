My programming background is Paul Dickson's Web Design class, the Jan Term Advanced Web Design course, and fooling around primarily with HTML and JavaScript.

I hope to learn Python and coding habits that others can readily understand. I also like learning new functions so I can consider their potential, which really is the strongest incentive to learn programming in an out of the classroom context.
